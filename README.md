## Usage
The usage can vary depending on which assistive technology tool is being used. You can download a free chrome extension called [Screen-Reader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screen-reader/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn?hl=en) to see the accessibility in action.
1. Open the link for the screen reader and it will bring you to here:

2.  Next select add to chrome:

    ![](/Assets/01-challenge-guide.png)

3. It is now installed. You should hear the screen reader talking already, and it will now read out wherever you click on chrome.

4. Open up the html file in chrome or see the [Deployed Site](#deployed-site) section for the live site link.

5. You are all set to use the site! Click anywhere on the page to have it read out to you. Click on pictures to hear the alt text.

6. Remove the extension by selecting the puzzle piece in the top right. Then, select the three dots next to the Screen Reader extension and in the drop down menu select the "remove extension" option:

### Sidenote:
Many but not all assistive technology tools have support for the use of an aria label, which was used to make the background image accessible. However, all the alt attributes for the other images should work interchangably with your tool of choice.
